Ferguson Police officer Darren WilsonAbout 75 to 100 people gathered Saturday in southwest St. Louis to show support for the Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson, who fatally shot Michael Brown.About 20 people held signs with messages such as “Justice Comes In All Colors” and “We Support PO Wilson.” Some motorists driving by honked in apparent solidarity.Many in the largely white crowd wore T-shirts with a badge insignia. The gathering was on the parking lot and sidewalk outside Barney’s Sports Pub on Chippewa Street near Hampton Avenue.Some people interviewed at the rally said the public should withhold judgment on Wilson’s actions in the shooting death of Brown until the investigation is completed. The judicial process should be respected, they said.“Until the facts are all out, you can’t judge,” said one rally participant, Dave Mueller, 54, of St. Louis. Mueller said he has friends and family members in law enforcement.But a woman who addressed rally-goers on behalf of the Support Darren Wilson Campaign said Wilson’s actions were “warranted and justified.”She said supporters of Wilson have received death threats. “Can justice ever be attained if one side’s supporters live in fear of speaking out?” She would not identify herself.Referring to reporters at the rally, she said “we want to thank the media for finally hitting the other side of the story.” However, she said media coverage has showed a clear “bias.”— Jacob BarkerCALM IN FERGUSONAll was calm in Ferguson this morning with residents busying themselves with everyday activities.Several groups were stationed in the Canfield Green Apartments near a memorial for Michael Brown with tables set up with giveaways for residents.Sheree Ollie of Live Church in Jennings had her arms full of items she carried over to a table. She said today was a day of hope for St. Louis area churches gathering with food for anyone in the community. A band was being set up for music.Ollie said it was going to be a day of music, praying, preaching, singing and dancing to uplift the community.Nearby, a Crisis Nursery van sat with its rear door open full of packages of diapers, wipes, baby formula, backpacks, pajamas, toys, lotions and non-perishable food the group was giving out to residents. Dianne Mueller, chief executive officer, helped workers divide the items up.“These are things mothers in the community told us that they needed,” Mueller said. “We are making sure that Crisis Nursery is right here in the community where they need us.”Mueller heard that residents were having trouble getting out and sprung into action. They have been in the community all week providing services.“It was important for us to be right here so they can get the help they need,” she said.Mueller said several children came for services this week because of complications from tear gas.“We were able to take care of that,” she said.Two marches are planned for this afternoon in Ferguson, one by St. Louis 4 Unity and the other by Missouri NAACP youth leadership.— Denise HollinshedPEACE MARCH PLANNED MONDAYA “peace march” has been called for Monday afternoon by a new group called New Spirit of St. Louis and Gitana Productions Inc.According to the Gitana website, the goal is to bring together “multicultural peace lovers” dressed in white.
